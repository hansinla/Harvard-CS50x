0.  BMP     32-bits per pixel (32bpp) format supports 4,294,967,296 distinct colors
    GIF      8-bits per pixel (from a 24-bit RGB color space)   256 distinct colors
    JPEG    24-bits per pixel                            16,777,216 distinct colors
    PNG     24-bits per pixel (or 32 bits RGBA)          16,777,216 distinct colors
1.  GIF supports animation, although there's an addendum to PNG, called APNG, that allows animation, but it is not widely supported
2.  In a lossy compression, we lose information and the process is not reversable.
    Lossless compression retains all the data and is reversable.
3.  GIF is lossy only, all other formats support both lossy and lossles compression.
4.  The system modifies the file's first character in the file's directory to signify that the file has been deleted
    and secondly the system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters.
5.  Overwrite every bit with a zero.
6.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library that declares integer data of fixed widths.
7.  uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t define unsigned integers of a fixed number of bits,
    which is significant for cross platform uses.
8.  BYTE  -> uint8_t  so 1 byte
    DWORD -> uint32_t so 4 bytes
    LONG  -> int32_t  so 4 bytes
    WORD  -> uint16_t so 2 bytes
9.  BM
10. bfSize -> The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file (in the BITMAPFILEHEADER)
    biSize -> The number of bytes required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
12. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel
    and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
13. If fope fails to open a file, it returns a NULL pointer. Possible causes icude:
    The file exists and the permissions specified by mode are denied, or the file does not exist and write permission is denied
    The maximum allowable number of files is currently open in the system.
    The file does not exist, and the file was to be created, etc.
14. The third argument of fread is 1 since we read one RGBTRIPPLE at a time.
15. Since bi.biWidth = 1 byte, the scanline is "padded" with 3 bytes to extend the scanlineâ€™s length to a multiple of 4.
16. The fseek function is used to change the file position of the stream.
17. Function: int fseek (FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence
    The value of whence must be one of the constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, to indicate whether the offset is relative
    to the beginning of the file, the current file position, or the end of the file, respectively.
